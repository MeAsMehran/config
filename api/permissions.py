DRF Permission Notes (for Future Reference)


===>> has_permission(request, view)
Called before accessing any object.
Controls general access to the view (e.g. list, create).
Use for checks like IsAuthenticated, IsAdminUser, etc.



===>> has_object_permission(request, view, obj)
Called after the object is retrieved.
Controls access to a specific object (e.g. detail, update, delete).
Use to restrict actions to owners or based on object fields.


ðŸ§  Tip:
Always return True/False based on the logic you need.
Both methods must pass for access to be granted.
